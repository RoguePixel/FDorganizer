Alright, here's some features that should be implemented:

1. recursively search in a given dir (script should accept as command line argument)
	*optional - specify depth script searches for music
2. Read metadata of music files - ID3 info
	*extra - if a song has no ID3 info automatically add it by parsing the title of song.
3. Organize music 
	* Sort songs according to artist 
	* Create dirs for artist/albums/genre etc..

Extra/optional/in-the-future
4. setup command line switches for script to accept arguments 
5. Create gui version?

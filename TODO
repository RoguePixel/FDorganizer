Alright, here's some features that should be implemented:

1. recursively search in a given dir (script should accept as command line argument)
	*optional - specify depth script searches for music
2. Read metadata of music files - ID3 info
	*extra - if a song has no ID3 info automatically add it by parsing the title of song.
3. Organize music 
	* Sort songs according to artist 
	* Create dirs for artist/albums/genre etc..

Extra/optional/in-the-future
4. setup command line switches for script to accept arguments 
5. Create gui version?

TODO list:

1. Add code to scan files from other script
2. Look into helpful python modules

IMPORTANT!

Need operation, method, or algorithm to output name for creating directories base on matching words in the title of files found. 
If a file does not share a title then it could be moved to an "unsorted" folder to be renamed manually.
